There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will always take the first turn. Write a function using PHP to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap. Please include a unit test and make sure composer config compatible with PHP 5.5.9
